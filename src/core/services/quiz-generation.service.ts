INPUT:
- Topic title (context for the questions)
- Source text (the only material to base questions on)

OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON):
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "stem": "Question text",
      "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Optional explanation why the correct answer is right"
    }
  ]
}

QUESTION GENERATION RULES:

1. Generate 3-8 questions depending on text length and complexity:
   - Short text (<500 words): 3-4 questions
   - Medium text (500-1500 words): 5-6 questions
   - Long text (>1500 words): 7-8 questions

2. Question Types - BALANCE BETWEEN UNDERSTANDING AND KEY FACTS:

   **PRIORITIZE (70% of questions):**
   ‚úÖ Conceptual understanding:
      - WHY something happens or is important
      - HOW concepts relate to each other
      - WHAT effects or consequences result
      - Comparisons and relationships
      - Applications and implications
   
   **INCLUDE (30% of questions):**
   ‚úÖ Important facts and key information:
      - Essential dates, names, or terms that are CENTRAL to the topic
      - Key terminology that defines the field
      - Important figures or events that shaped the domain
   
   **AVOID:**
   ‚ùå Trivial details from examples:
      - Names used only as illustrations (e.g., "What was the company called in example 2?")
      - Arbitrary numbers or specifics that aren't key learning points
      - Details that don't contribute to understanding
   
   **How to distinguish:**
   
   üìö History:
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "Why did the French Revolution begin?" (conceptual - causes)
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "When did World War II end?" (important fact - major historical date)
   ‚ùå BAD: "What was the street address mentioned in the historical account?" (trivial detail)
   
   üß™ Science:
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "Why does water boil at 100¬∞C at sea level?" (conceptual - understanding)
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "What is the chemical formula for water?" (essential fact - key terminology)
   ‚ùå BAD: "What was the temperature of the water in the example experiment?" (arbitrary detail from example)
   
   üíº Business:
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "What advantages does this marketing strategy provide?" (conceptual - analysis)
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "What does ROI stand for?" (important terminology)
   ‚ùå BAD: "What was the name of the startup used as an example?" (example-specific, not transferable)
   
   üé® Art:
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "How does impressionism differ from realism?" (conceptual - comparison)
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "Who painted the Mona Lisa?" (essential fact - major work)
   ‚ùå BAD: "What was the painting used to illustrate color theory in this text?" (example detail)
   
   üìñ Literature:
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "What is the central theme of this work?" (conceptual - understanding)
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "Who wrote 'War and Peace'?" (important fact - major author)
   ‚ùå BAD: "What page number was quoted in the text?" (trivial detail)

3. The Key Distinction:
   
   ASK YOURSELF: "Is this information..."
   
   ‚úÖ CORE to the topic? ‚Üí Include it
      - "When did WWII end?" - This IS the topic
      - "What is photosynthesis?" - This IS what we're learning
   
   ‚úÖ HELPS understand the concept? ‚Üí Include it
      - "Why did the war start?" - Explains causation
      - "How does X differ from Y?" - Builds understanding
   
   ‚ùå Just an EXAMPLE detail? ‚Üí Skip it
      - "What company was mentioned as an example?"
      - "What was the character's name in the illustration?"
      - These are scaffolding, not the learning objective

4. Balance Guidelines:
   - Aim for 60-70% conceptual/understanding questions
   - Include 30-40% essential facts and terminology
   - 0% trivial or example-specific details

5. Each question must be answerable using ONLY the provided text:
   - No external knowledge required
   - No opinion-based or subjective questions
   - No trick questions or deliberately misleading options
   - Do not reference images, diagrams, or visual elements

6. Options Requirements:
   - Exactly 4 options per question
   - One clearly correct answer
   - Three plausible but incorrect distractors
   - All options should be similar in length and complexity
   - Distractors should represent common misunderstandings

7. Question Language:
   - Questions and answers MUST be in the same language as the source text

8. Coverage:
   - Cover different key concepts and essential facts from the source text
   - Focus on main ideas and important information, not minor details
